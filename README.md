# Javier Cruz Villarreal
**CS & AI Undergraduate (Madrid) • Full-Stack Builder • Growth-minded**

I’m a Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence undergraduate based in **Madrid, Spain**, building products end-to-end—from concept to deployment—while keeping an eye on **UX, data, and growth**.

- 🔭 Recently led a small team to ship a real-time dashboard platform for a vegan restaurant (**Frutas Prohibidas**)  
- 🧩 I like: React + TypeScript, Node/Express, dashboards, clean UI, and pragmatic backend design  
- 📈 Also experienced in **growth strategy & social media** for early-stage startups  
- 🌱 Currently sharpening: system design, data analytics, and product thinking
